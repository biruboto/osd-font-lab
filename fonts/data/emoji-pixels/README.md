# Emoji Pixels Library

Special-character emoji glyphs with explicit pixel values:

- `1` transparent
- `2` white
- `3` black

Each file stores one full-cell glyph (`12x18` by default). This preserves
internal black detail while still allowing stroke-aware rendering in the
special-character pipeline.
