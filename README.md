OSD Font Lab is a web application designed to help people create custom fonts for analog FPV OSDs with a "swap/replace/nudge" workflow. Currently the app allows you to:
+ Load an .MCM file or begin with the included Betaflight defaults
+ Instantly replace all typable characters with gorgeous bitmap fonts by Damien Guard, or from the Atari Eight Bit collection, or by importing a .yaff file, like those available from the [Hoard of Bitfonts](https://github.com/robhagemans/hoard-of-bitfonts/tree/master)
+ Nudge the characters around to match baselines and horizontal spacing etc
+ Choose from a pre-selected assortment of single glyphs or "sets" (batteries, crosshairs) and mix and match them from the Betaflight defaults or a small (but growing!) selection of custom OSD FL icons
+ Export to either .MCM or .PNG
